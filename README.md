### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Create the Script File:**
   - Open a terminal on your Linux system.
   - Create a new file named `processrunning.sh` using a text editor like `vi` or `nano`.
     ```bash
     vi processrunning.sh
     ```

2. **Write the Script:**
   - Add the following lines to the file:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Displaying all running processes:"
     ps aux
     echo "Total processes running: $(ps aux | wc -l)"
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

3. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Change the permissions of the script to make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x processrunning.sh
     ```

4. **Execute the Script:**
   - Run the script on your system:
     ```bash
     ./processrunning.sh
     ```
   - The script will display a list of all running processes, followed by the total number of processes.

5. **Review the Output:**
   - The script will first output a detailed list of running processes using the `ps aux` command.
   - It will then count the total number of processes and display this count.

6. **Test the Script:**
   - Ensure the script runs correctly and provides accurate information.
   - If needed, modify the script for additional functionality or to refine the output.

### Conclusion:
This project involves creating a simple but effective shell script to monitor system processes, which can be useful for understanding system performance and managing resources. By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a functional script that meets the problem's objectives.
